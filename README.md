## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site showcases information about me, my skills, projects, and provides a contact form. It also includes interactive features such as a modal window, dark mode toggle, dynamically generated content, and client-side storage.

The project is built using core web technologies with a focus on clean structure, accessibility, and beginner-friendly JavaScript patterns.
